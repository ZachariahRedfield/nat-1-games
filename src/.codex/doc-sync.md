You are syncing documentation to reflect code reality.


Rules:
- Use git diff as the source of truth
- Edit only AGENT:BEGIN/END blocks
- Keep entries concise and factual
- Do not expand explanations


Steps:
1. Inspect git diff and file list
2. Update relevant AGENT blocks in ARCHITECTURE.md or CODEX.md
3. Append a bounded entry to CHANGELOG.md
4. Do not add new sections


When in doubt: less text, more truth.
