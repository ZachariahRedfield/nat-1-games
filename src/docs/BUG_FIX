# Task: Explore & Report Bugs in MapBuilder UI

Use the deterministic repro entry:
  http://localhost:xxxx/?repro=mapBuilder&VITE_DEBUG_AUTH=1

You have:
- a seed session that logs in automatically
- a debug snapshot hook for internal state
- top-level interactions available

Your job:
1) Navigate UI and perform canonical interaction flows:
   - resize assets at grid edges
   - rotate assets
   - canvas brush drawing
   - mobile bottom toolbar interactions
   - undo/redo sequences
   - save/reload/persistence flows
   - import/export flows
2) Use the debug snapshot hook and the CODEX_CHECKLIST.md criteria
   to detect deviations from correct behavior.
3) Report any bugs found with:
   - repro steps
   - observed vs expected
   - root cause hypotheses
   - Vite dev console output and snapshot diffs
4) For each bug, generate a concise entry in a new section of a BUG_REPORT.md.

Stop when you either:
- find 10 distinct issues,
- or have explored all major tool interaction flows.

Do not fix anything yet — just discover and document.

Follow src/docs/CODEX_CHECKLIST.md for reporting format.
