# BUG_REPORTER: Explore & Report Bugs in MapBuilder UI

This workflow is for discovery and planning ONLY.
Do not implement fixes in this mode.

Use the deterministic repro entry:
  http://localhost:xxxx/?repro=mapBuilder&debug=1

You have:
- a seed session that logs in automatically
- a debug snapshot hook for internal state
- top-level interactions available

## Your job
1) Navigate the UI and perform canonical interaction flows:
   - resize assets at grid edges
   - rotate assets
   - canvas brush drawing
   - mobile bottom toolbar interactions
   - undo/redo sequences
   - save/reload/persistence flows
   - import/export flows

2) Use the debug snapshot hook and CODEX_CHECKLIST.md criteria
   to detect deviations from correct behavior.

3) For each bug found, document:
   - repro steps (deterministic if possible)
   - observed vs expected behavior
   - 1–3 root cause hypotheses
   - likely owning files/modules
   - any automation evidence (console output, snapshot diffs)

4) Append a concise entry to:
   - src/docs/BUG_REPORT.md

## Stop conditions
Stop when either:
- 10 distinct issues are found, OR
- all major interaction flows have been explored.

## Important constraints
- Do NOT modify source code.
- Do NOT add or update tests.
- Do NOT add changelog entries.
- This workflow produces reports only.

## Required handoff
At the end of the report, select:
- the single highest-impact / lowest-risk issue to fix first

Then include a **BUG_FIX handoff block** with:
- issue title
- repro steps
- most likely root cause
- target files
- suggested unit test target(s)

Follow src/docs/CODEX_CHECKLIST.md for reporting format.
